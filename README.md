# ThreadsPractice
Practice using threads in C

*The program executed x number of threads where x is the number inputer by the user.
*The threads are to access a shared variable and add 1 to it and finally display the final value it sees.
*If PTHREADS_SYNC is defined, the threads will be synchronized. otherwise threads will not be.

USE THE MAKEFILE TO EXECUTE AND RUN THE PROGRAM.

*To build the program. (This will prompt you to build the program with PTHREAD_SYNC defined or not)
```
$ make build
```
